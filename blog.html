  <p>After starting to read Samin Nosrat's <em>'Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat'</em> I decided to explore the roles of salt, fat and acid in the cooking of scrambled eggs.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div><p>
  <img id="eggs" src=saltfatacid.jpg>
  I used five eggs (any leftovers went to the dogs), cooking with olive oil, butter, fine sea salt, coarse sea salt flakes and a lemon:
  <ol>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Butter and Salt</li>
    <li>Butter and Lemon</li>
    <li>Butter, Salt and Lemon</li>
  </ol>
<h4>These are my findings:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Tasted buttery, oddly enough, but they were also silky, soft but short on flavour.</li>
  <li>A little watery. They had a little more flavour but not worth the trade off for the silkiness and lip-smacking buttery taste cooking in butter provided.</li>
  <li>Delicious! Silky, soft, warming, full of flavour (unfortunately none of this made the dog bowl)! But quite heavy.</li>
  <li>First thing I noticed is that it cooks differently. The eggs don't dry up and scramble with the heat but instead there is this wonderful transformation of watery egg to cream. The eggs were much more tender, lighter, the flavours balanced, making the eggs refreshing. There was a subtle kick of lemon that came through making them a little zingy! It was nice, but maybe an indication I add a little too much lemon juice.</li>
  <li>The best. Salty, like 3., but not heavy. I added a less lemon and there was little to no lemon taste, it just brightened the dish and balanced the salt.</li>
</ol>
</p></div>
<div>
<img id="eggs" src=eggs5.jpg>
<p>The winner, perhaps obvious, was 5. To both 3. and 5. I added some coarse sea salt flakes after the first taste, and found it added a marvellous crunch to the dish. Texture can be just as important as flavour, and these crunchy flakes added something new to the monotonous texture of silky scrambled eggs. After that, 5. just tasted perfect and I'm looking forward to breakfast tomorrow!</p>

<p>This will probably bore the hell out of a lot of you so I've tied it with a more interesting post about <em>'The Perfect Scrambled Eggs'</em> (will post later today) so I don't lose my entire audience.</p>
<p>But the bins in our kitchen stink, and always have done. And having so much time on my hands, and spending most of it in the kitchen, I thought it was time to take action. So these are the following steps I've taken to make putting things in the bin less of a "Let's open and close this as quickly as possible before I feel sick" experience:
<ul>
  <li>All <strong>compost waste</strong> such as onion ends, peels, scraps, etc., excluding meat, will now go into a kitchen-side compost bin (using a plastic bag until it arrives) and emptied at the end of the day into the <em>Bee Hive</em> compost bin.</li>
  <li>The front, larger, bin is now <strong>recycling</strong> and the back, smaller, bin is general waste. Having the recycling bin at the front makes it more accessible and should encourage more recycling. As the Bajans say, "<em>Save the turtles!</em> ".</li>
  <li>We will <strong>no longer use bin bags</strong>, to reduce plastic waste, and <strong>wash out any trash</strong> (e.g. tuna cans) before throwing away to prevent bad smells (especially in the heat).</li>
  <li><strong>Educate</strong> ourselves on what can be reycled and what can't (I think my poster is pretty rad).</li>
</ul>

      <h3 class="post-title">Hey, I’m a scientist at heart.</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>So, I’ve just cooked <em> Steak with buttery linguine </em> and it needs improvement. Studying science for most of my life, I think I’ll approach it with the same attitude: write a method, practice, critique the method, write a new method, practice, etc.</p>
        <p><h4>Serves 3</h4></p>
        <img src="steak with buttery linguine 1.jpg" height, width="250" style="float: right;">
        <p> <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>3 sirloin steaks, with high-quality marbling,</li>
            <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped, </li>
            <li>2 sprigs rosemary,</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove,</li>
            <li>1 organic beef stock pot,</li>
            <li>300g linguine,</li>
            <li>olive oil, for frying</li>
            <li>butter, for frying,</li>
            <li>high-quality extra virgin olive oil.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Method:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Salt the steaks the night before and leave in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle or frying pan over a high heat. Splash some water onto the pan and when it sizzles you know it’s ready. Then add the olive oil and, when hot, the onions, rosemary and a pinch of salt; fry until browning.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile cook the linguine in salted boiling water, for one minute less than pack instructions. Drain immediately, then put back into the empty pan.</li>
            <li>Once the onions begin to brown, grate the garlic in and add the stock pot. Stir continuously so the stock doesn’t catch on the bottom of the pan. Cook until the onions are brown and softened.</li>
            <li>Move the onions to one side and in the space add olive oil. Once hot add a dollop of butter followed by the steaks when it begins to sizzle. Cook for 2 minutes each side (rare).</li>
            <li>Remove the steaks and leave to rest. Pour the juices and onion from the pan into the linguine, removing the rosemary. If the spaghetti needs loosening add some extra-virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li>Slice the steaks and plate on-top of the linguine. <em> Bon appetite </em>.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Critique:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Steaks:</strong> cooked beautifully. The thicker steak was a bit undercooked so put it on the pan for a bit longer, but the fat and salt used really brought them to life. The fat was a bit soft and I think could have benefited from crisping up. Next time I might <strong> remove the fat before cooking, chop up small and fry with the onions so that it goes crispy and mix in with the linguine </strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Griddle pan:</strong> usually great for steaks so I thought why not: I now know why not. Too small to fit everything in, the grooves stop even mixing of the stock and a lot caught on the bottom of the pan. Next time using <strong> a normal frying pan. </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil:</strong> the meal was beautifully fatty, butter smacking from the lips in every bite, however, I think I used too much: olive oil, butter, fat from the steaks, extra-virgin. Next time I would <strong> cut the extra-virgin out, reserving some pasta water after draining and using that to loosen the linguine. </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Colour:</strong> the dish was very bland in appearance, the only colour coming from the rare steak. With the high fat content of the meal, I think the dish would benefit from something bitter and I believe <strong> swiss/rhubarb chard steamed and turned through the linguine </strong> would give it that. The bright colour of chard would also add interest to the look of the dish. Using three rosemary sprigs could also be an idea. <strong> That way a sprig could be placed on top of each steak as a garnish. </strong></li>
          </ul>
          Overall though, the dish was impressive. It exceeded my expectations and I ended wolfing it down. The steak was cooked beautifully, and the linguine held onto all the juices that ran out. I’ll try and post the new recipe tomorrow!

      <h3 class="post-title">Cherry picking</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Today I'm doing a couple of things:</p>
        <p>Picking some fresh produce from my garden like apples and blackberries. I intend to freeze both and use in the following months for crumbles, etc. The apples, having tried one, are bitter, possibly underripe, but are usually destroyed by wasps every year, therefore we are going to pick them early, freeze, and use them to cook with.</p>
        <p>My brother's girlfriend's parents are coming to eat with us on 7 September and I intend to make use of said frozen fruit in a seasonal crumble.</p>
        <p>I am also trying the recipe I posted earlier in the week, Steak with buttery linguine; however I have made a few changes. I've cut out the red wine sauce as I fear it will be too 'present' and will use a garlic and rosemary butter sauce instead. I am also making use of some donated swiss chard as an accompaniment. I will post the new recipe tomorrow or Tuesday. I have salted the steaks, sat on the side the salt is pulling the flavour out and my dogs are enviously licking their lips -a dog's life.</p>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>I had the following idea for a recipe:</p>
        <p> <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>4 sirloin steaks</li>
            <li>butter, for frying</li>
            <li>360g linguine</li>
            <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
            <li>concentrated beef stock</li>
            <li> red wine sauce (see <strong> <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/red-wine-sauce">here</a> </strong>)</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h4>Method:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>24 hours before cooking, salt the steaks and leave in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Cook the linuine following pack instructions in salted water, cooking for one minute less than the packet says.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt the butter over a medium-high heat and fry the onions with a few drops of the beef stock until golden-brown. Then add the steaks and cook for 2 minutes each side (medium-rare)</li>
            <li>Remove the steaks from the pan and leave to rest. Add the linguine straight from the cooking water to the steak pan and stir around to coat in the juices -add more butter if needed.</li>
            <li>Plate the steaks, then add a 'nest' of the linguine next to each and add the red wine sauce so that it forms a pool around the two.</li>
          </ol>
